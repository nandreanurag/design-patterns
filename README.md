# Design Patterns Repository

## Overview
This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to various design patterns, including creational, behavioral, and structural patterns. This repository aims to provide clear explanations and Ecommerce examples of design patterns commonly used in software development.

## Contents
The repository includes:

### Creational Patterns - To be Added
- **Singleton:** Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Factory Method:** Defines an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Abstract Factory:** Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Builder:** Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

### Behavioral Patterns - To be Added
- **Observer:** Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **Strategy:** Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
- **Command:** Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
- **State:** Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

### Structural Patterns
- **Adapter:** Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
- **Decorator:** Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
- **Facade:** Provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code, such as a class library.
- **Proxy:** Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
- **Composite:** Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
- **Bridge:** Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

## Usage
Each design pattern is organized within its respective directory, containing implementation examples in various programming languages. Feel free to explore the examples, study the code, and adapt it to your projects as needed.
